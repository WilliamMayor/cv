### Profile

I'm a code monkey at heart; I love building solutions. I am a usability enthusiast, lots of my work at Diversity and Ability focusses around making software and the web accessible and usable. I think coding is fun and rewarding and that more people should do it. I work with an educational trust to deliver programming courses to 16-18 year-olds. In my spare time I like to code, I also enjoy wood turning, cooking, and the occasional video game.
