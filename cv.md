### Profile

I'm a code monkey at heart; I love building solutions. I am a usability enthusiast, lots of my work at Diversity and Ability focusses around making software and the web accessible and usable. I also enjoy exploring and playing with data. My MRes and MPhil research looked at distributed, peer-to-peer networks with millions of nodes, exploring that data space was a fantastic challenge. In my spare time I like to code, I also enjoy wood turning, cooking, and the occasional video game.
